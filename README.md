# ccc-py
## Overview
ccc-py is a simple GUI application that uses Tkinter to perform character code conversion.  
Takes a hexadecimal string and converts it to the following character codes:  

+ `ASCII`
+ `ISO-8859-1`
+ `Shift_JIS`
+ `UTF-8`  
+ `UTF-16`  

The purpose of this project is two-fold.
The first is to practice building applications using tkinter. The mvc model was used for the design.
The second is that I have recently become interested in viewing and editing binary data and wanted a program that would help.
